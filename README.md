#Coffee Shop Webpage

This project is a webpage designed for a coffee shop that belongs to the triple peaks library. In the webpage users are able to view the menu, book a reservation, and see the information about the coffee shop. In addition to this, there are videos that show how to create coffee with recipes.  

In the future, I think I'd like to make the page more bold and add photos of the products for customers to have a sneak peak of what they are getting.
